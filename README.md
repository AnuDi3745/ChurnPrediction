# ChurnPrediction
This is my task for Sunbase Internship.

I have not uploaded the Model File here asa github has restrictions on size. 
Please Download Model File from here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RCnUDGl5GtER4xNf6mbx1hemfxs8aZE3/view?usp=sharing

Change the path of the Model here:
https://github.com/AnuDi3745/ChurnPrediction/blob/2edd96fd2a611b8e32458a700cd7a81089e79e94/CP%20app.py#L12

To view the deployed model, just type:

> python -m streamlit run "path\CP app.py"

in your command prompt.
